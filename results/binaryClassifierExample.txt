For the below song which belongs to the pop genre, we have
tested with all the 5 models that were built. After training
the model, we tested the accuracy of the model with just
one song and the label was given as "Non Genre" for all
the models.

------------------------------------------------
Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time

Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies, only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time

Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time
And who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time

Who knows? Only time
Who knows? Only time
------------------------------------------------

We have found that the models "Rock", "Country", "Hip-Hop" and "Jazz"
predicted correctly that the song does not belong to their genres and
can be reflected from the accuracy which is 1.0 as the model correctly
predicted that the song as "Non Genre"

Whereas, the Pop model predicted that the song belongs to the Pop genre
This can be seen from the accuracy of the model which says 0 as the original
label was given as "Non Pop".
