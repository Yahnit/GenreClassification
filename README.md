This is a part of the digital humanities project.

On top of this, I have trained the Classifiers with different
sizes of dataset and analysed the accuracy of the classifiers as the sizes of datasets changed. With increase in the size of dataset which was trained, it led to increase in accuracies. However, the training time was increasing rapidly with increase in training dataset. I have done the same thing with the binary classifier as well. In CNN's I tried with more number of filter sizes and different number of convolutional and maxpool layers. In the data analysis section, I correlated the most unique words occuring in a particular type of genre with the nature of the genre.
